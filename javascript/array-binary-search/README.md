# Binary Search of Sorted Array
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
 Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Logical thinking (using while loop to search the index number in array) & solving step by step .

The Big O for this approach is :

- Time : O(log(n)).
- Space : O(1).
